				>This site is still a WIP. There are a things I could polish and more fandoms I could

			This website aims to archive all fanfictions from some fandoms in <a
				target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer"
				href="https://archiveofourown.org">archiveofourown.org</a
			>. This website works by constantly watching new works in AO3 and saving the work for archival
			purposes. Think of it like
			<a target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" href="https://archive.org/web"
				>The WaybackMachine</a
			> but for fanficitons in AO3.
		</p>
		<p>Currently, we only archive these fandoms:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>OMORI</li>
			<li>僕のヒーローアカデミア | Boku no Hero Academia | My Hero Academia</li>
			<li>Chainsaw Man</li>
			<li>Hetalia: Axis Powers</li>
			<li>Haikyuu!</li>
			<li>Pocket Monsters | Pokemon</li>
			<li>Undertale</li>
			<li>Deltarune</li>
			<li>原神 | Genshin Impact</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Works that contain any of these tags will be automatically saved and archived to this site. If
			the work is deleted in AO3, then a copy of the work will stay here, untouched.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are an author of a work and want it to get deleted from this site, please contact me
			through discord, <b>STRCH#0001</b>
