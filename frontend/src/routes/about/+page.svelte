			This website aims to archive all fanfictions from some fandoms in <a
				target="_blank"
				rel="noopener noreferrer"
				href="https://archiveofourown.org">archiveofourown.org</a
			>. This website works by constantly watching new works in AO3 and extracting the information
			needed to archive the work (the content, the notes, the summary, and etc.)
		</p>
		<p>Currently, we only archive these fandoms:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>OMORI</li>
			<li>僕のヒーローアカデミア | Boku no Hero Academia | My Hero Academia</li>
			<li>Chainsaw Man</li>
			<li>Hetalia: Axis Powers</li>
			<li>Haikyuu!</li>
			<li>Pocket Monsters | Pokemon</li>
			<li>Undertale</li>
			<li>Deltarune</li>
			<li>原神 | Genshin Impact</li>
		</ul>
		<p>
			Works that contain any of these tags will be automatically saved and archived to this site. If
			the work is deleted in AO3, the archive of the work stays here, untouched.
		</p>
		<p>
			If you are an author of a work and want it to get deleted from this site, please contact me
			through discord, <b>TraceL#0001</b>
