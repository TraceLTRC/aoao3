## What is AOAO3

archiveofarchiveofourown (AOAO3 for the sane mind) is a website dedicated to archiving a part of the very popular fanworks hosting site, [Archive Of Our Own](https://archiveofourown.org/).

The site constantly looks for new works posted to AO3, and copies it to a seperate database. If the work is deleted in AO3, it'll stay in this site for anyone to view. Each work has their own "snapshots", where each snapshot contains the entire copy of the work (excluding comments).
